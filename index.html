        What does the name mean?</button></h3>
        <div id="collapse1" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
      <p>CHRIST is not the last name of Jesus. It is His title, who He is for us. Peter confessed concerning Jesus “You
        are the Christ!” (Matt 16:16). The word Christ comes from Greek meaning anointed. Prophets, priests and kings
        were anointed. Jesus is the anointed one for us. The Old Testament promised the coming of THE CHRIST. The New
        Testament proclaims that Jesus is THE CHRIST who has come to save sinners.</p>
      <p>COMMUNITY is a gift from God through His Word and Sacraments. The Greek word for community can also be
        translated as fellowship. This word most profoundly refers to the communion and fellowship that Christians have
        with Jesus. Because each Christian has fellowship (communion) with Jesus so Christian’s have community with each
        other as brothers and sisters in Jesus…THE CHRIST! (1 John 1:3) A community of Christians is something only
        Jesus…THE CHRIST creates and sustains through His Church by His Word, Spirit and Sacraments.

        <div id="collapse2" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
      <p>“But where the Holy Scriptures are not the rule, I advise no one to send his child. Everything
        must perish where God’s Word is not studied unceasingly.” – Martin Luther, 1520</p>
      <p>“…if we wish to have excellent and able persons both for civil and Church leadership, we must
        spare no diligence, time, or cost in teaching and educating our children, so that they may
        serve God and the world. We must not think only about how we may amass money and
        possessions for them. God can indeed support and make them rich without us, as He daily
        does. But for this purpose He has given us children and issued this command: we should train
        and govern them according to His will. Otherwise, He would have no purpose for a father and
        a mother. Therefore, let everyone know that it is his duty, on peril of losing the divine favor, to
        bring up his children in the fear and knowledge of God above all things [Proverbs 1:7]…
        If that were done, God would also richly bless us and give us grace to train men by whom
        land and people might be improved. He would also bless us with well-educated citizens, chaste
        and domestic wives, who, afterward, would raise godly children… Here consider now what
        deadly harm you are doing if you are negligent and fail on your part to bring up your children
        to usefulness and piety. Consider how you bring upon yourself all sin and wrath, earning hell
        by your own children, even though you are otherwise pious and holy. Because this matter is
        disregarded, God so fearfully punishes the world that there is no discipline, government, or
        peace. We all complain about this but do not see that it is our fault. The way we train
        children and subjects spoils them and makes them disobedient. God commands that we bring
        children up in the fear and love of God.” -Large Catechism on the 4th Commandment</p></div>

      <p>1. The congregations supporting CCLS are distinctively Lutheran.<br>
        2. Lutheran teaching holds up God’s Word as the only source of the Christian Faith.<br>
        3. Lutherans have established and operated schools throughout the world.<br>
        4. Education has been central to Lutheran congregations for over 500 years.<br>

        holy and evil will mold young hearts to seek God. The curriculum and education at CCLS will be guided by it’s
        Consortium of Classical Lutheran Education Accreditation. The Study of God’s Word and the Catechism along with
