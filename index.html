                <p>CHRIST is not the last name of Jesus. It is His title, who He is for us. Peter confessed concerning
                  Jesus “You are the Christ!” (Matt 16:16). The word Christ comes from Greek meaning anointed. Prophets,
                  priests and kings were anointed. Jesus is the anointed one for us. The Old Testament promised the
                  coming of THE CHRIST. The New Testament proclaims that Jesus is THE CHRIST who has come to save
                  sinners. </p>

                <p>COMMUNITY is a gift from God through His Word and Sacraments. The Greek word for community can also
                  be translated as fellowship. This word most profoundly refers to the communion and fellowship that
                  Christians have with Jesus. Because each Christian has fellowship (communion) with Jesus so
                  Christian’s have community with each other as brothers and sisters in Jesus…THE CHRIST! (1 John 1:3) A
                  community of Christians is something only Jesus…THE CHRIST creates and sustains through His Church by
                  His Word, Spirit and Sacraments.</p>

                <p>“But where the Holy Scriptures are not the rule, I advise no one to send his child. Everything must
                  perish where God’s Word is not studied unceasingly.” – Martin Luther, 1520</p>

                <p>“…if we wish to have excellent and able persons both for civil and Church leadership, we must spare
                  no diligence, time, or cost in teaching and educating our children, so that they may serve God and the
                  world. We must not think only about how we may amass money and possessions for them. God can indeed
                  support and make them rich without us, as He daily does. But for this purpose He has given us children
                  and issued this command: we should train and govern them according to His will. Otherwise, He would
                  have no purpose for a father and a mother. Therefore, let everyone know that it is his duty, on peril
                  of losing the divine favor, to bring up his children in the fear and knowledge of God above all things
                  [Proverbs 1:7]… If that were done, God would also richly bless us and give us grace to train men by
                  whom land and people might be improved. He would also bless us with well-educated citizens, chaste and
                  domestic wives, who, afterward, would raise godly children… Here consider now what deadly harm you are
                  doing if you are negligent and fail on your part to bring up your children to usefulness and piety.
                  Consider how you bring upon yourself all sin and wrath, earning hell by your own children, even though
                  you are otherwise pious and holy. Because this matter is disregarded, God so fearfully punishes the
                  world that there is no discipline, government, or peace. We all complain about this but do not see
                  that it is our fault. The way we train children and subjects spoils them and makes them disobedient.
                  God commands that we bring children up in the fear and love of God.” -Large Catechism on the 4th
